## Summary

The MVP web-based application was designed to help me collect data from several sites through the use of APIs display it in a single place, in a clean and simple way for ease and speed of use.

The application allows users to search for character data from the Warcraft Logs API, displaying the best and average data for that character.
The second main use for the application is to search auction house data using the NexusHub API, currently this will provide data from a random selection of ten items for proof of functionallity.
